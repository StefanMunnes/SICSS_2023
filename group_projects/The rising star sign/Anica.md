## What is your preferred outcome of this group work, i.e. do you want to continue working on this project after the Summer Institute and possibly develop it into a paper OR do you "just" want to use it as practice in the context of this Summer Institute?
I want to work on the project after the summer institute and possibly develop it into a paper. For my PhD I am working gender-inclusive language and using text analysis for different things and would ideally use what I do here as part of my PhD or an extra side project that is still related.

___
## Any additional notes?
Happy to work on a different project than mine if there is something more interesting.

I have some data already: around 380,000 paragraphs from 5 German newspapers that feature gender-inclusive language
+ 500 full articles that I scraped

I am happy to work alone or work in a group, depending on topical interest.
