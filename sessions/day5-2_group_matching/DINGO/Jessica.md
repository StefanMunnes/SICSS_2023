## What is your general topic / research field of interest (e.g., gender, extremism, social movements)?
Democracy promotion, global norm diffusion
___
## What is your specific research idea, if you have one?
I want to explore the aims and activities of democracy INGOs (DINGOs).
First, I will explore the qualities of DINGOs descriptively using data visualization techniques.
Then, I will use topic modeling to explore the different emergent themes present in DINGO aims and activities-
  overall, and over time.
My hope is that I can assign generated topic probabilities to each organization, which will enable me to 
  weight organizations according to their "propensity" to promote democracy in different ways.
I will also explore the terms which are most associated with the word "democracy"/"democracy promotion" over time to explore how their meaning has changed over time. I believe this will come from word embeddings.
It could be useful to look at organizations which are more "technical" vs. those which are more "practical" and see how the qualities of these organizations differ.
___
