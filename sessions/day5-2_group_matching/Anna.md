___
## What is your general topic / research field of interest (e.g., gender, extremism, social movements)?
reproduction policy, amongst other things: abortion or pregnancy care, and specifically in my dissertation: sex education. Geographical focus: high-income countries. Mostly comparative.

___
## What is your specific research idea, if you have one?
Analyse previously collected legal texts (laws, regulations, guidelines) on abortion and sex education policy from the project  International Reproduction Policy Database. Potentially scrape more data to have additional sources, depending on quality of existing data. 
___
## What would your prefered method of analysis be? And how do you rate your own skill level with that method?
Potentially look more into web scraping. Potentially use latent semantic analysis. Other than that, no specific preferred method of analysis; also my skill level in text-as-data is at a beginner level, so it would be great to pair up with someone (slightly) more experienced. 

___
## What is your overall skill level with R? 
Quite beginner-level but with stark improvements throughout this week already.

___
## What is your preferred outcome of this group work, i.e. do you want to continue working on this project after the Summer Institute and possibly develop it into a paper OR do you "just" want to use it as practice in the context of this Summer Institute?
Ideally I would like to continue working on the topic/project outside of SICSS and maybe even produce a publishable paper or research note.

___
## Any additional notes?
