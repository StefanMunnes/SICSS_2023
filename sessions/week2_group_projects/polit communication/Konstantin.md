## What is your general topic / research field of interest (e.g., gender, extremism, social movements)?
Very broadly: political economy and comparative politics
Flexible about working on anything political science-y
Or meta-research about academia (e.g. diversity issues)

___
## What is your specific research idea, if you have one?
1) More descriptive: how and why geographical and contextual labels (e.g. "European", "Central European", "Balkan", "post-socialist", "post-Soviet") get "attached" to countries and do certain political events cause shift in usage of these labels?
2) More causal: explain the empirical puzzle "much more lawyers in US Congress than other national parliaments". Does the appointment of judges, prosecutors/attorneys by election in states and counties contribute to the presence of lawyers in Congress?

___
## What would your prefered method of analysis be? And how do you rate your own skill level with that method?
computational methods: mostly what I learned here
other non-ML stats: experienced user & teacher

___
## What is your overall skill level with R? 
good. I am also familiar with using geo-referenced data in R

___
## What is your preferred outcome of this group work, i.e. do you want to continue working on this project after the Summer Institute and possibly develop it into a paper OR do you "just" want to use it as practice in the context of this Summer Institute?
100% want it to be high quality and publishable in political science and ready to work on that together after SICSS.
